\title{$\lambda$ 's on the edge \\ Functional Programming in C++ part deux}

\section* {Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This is a continuation of a previous article in which I discussed support for fucntional programming built into C++.
In this article I'll be looking to extend C++ to support advanced functional concepts like functors, applicative functors and monads.

\section*{Currying}
%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{\em Currying} turns any function into a higher order function of one variable \cite{field}.
The curry of the function returns a partially applied version of the original.

The operator $curry2$ is a higher order function which takes a binary function as input 
and returns a unary higher order function.
That function is the curry of the binary function.
%%--------
\begin{eqnarray*}
curry2 \; :: \; ((a,b) \rightarrow c) &\rightarrow& (a \rightarrow b \rightarrow c) \\
f::(a,b) \rightarrow c &\Rightarrow&  (curry2\;f)::a \rightarrow b \rightarrow c 
\end{eqnarray*}
%-----------------------------
When the curried version of $f$ is called with an argument of type $a$ it returns another unary function 
Calling this function with an argument of type $b$ returns the same value as $f$.
%%%
\begin{eqnarray*}
plus\;:\;:(int \;x, int \;y) \;::int = x+y &\Rightarrow& cplus(int\; x) \;::\; (int \rightarrow int)  \\
                                                             & & \rightarrow (int \; y) \;::\; int \rightarrow x+y  \\
plus(5,6) = 11 &\Leftrightarrow&(curry2 \; plus)(5)(6) = 11
\end{eqnarray*}
%%---------
$(curry2 plus)$ is the curried version of $plus$.
{\em curry2 plus)(5)} returns a lambda which represents the $plus$ function partially applied to 5. 
When this partially applied version of $plus$ is called with 6 an unsurprising 11 is the result.

Listing \ref{curry2} shows an implementation of curry2 in C++: 
%--
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=curry for binary operators, label=curry2]
template <typename R, typename T, typename U>
std::function<std::function<R (U)> (T)> curry(std::function<R (T,U)> op)
{
  return [=] (T x) { return [=] (U y) {return op(x, y);};};
}
  auto l = curry<int,int, int> ([](int x, int y) { return (5 + x) * y;});
  std::cout << l(1)(1) << std::endl; //prints 6
\end{lstlisting}
%---
Currying plays an important role in functional programming \cite{field}. 
It simplifies the design of higher order functions because we only have to consider unary functions.

C++ does not provide a curry operator and functions are not written in curried form. 
Compare this to Haskell where functions are curried by default \cite{lipovaca, hutton}.
However writing a curry operator or writing curried versions of a function has become a lot easier now that lambda's are supported.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section*{Functors}
%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Functors generalize the concept of mapping a function over values in a container.
Their typeclass is :
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mbox{class Functor f where} \\
fmap :: (a \rightarrow b) -> f\;a \rightarrow f\;b
\end{eqnarray*}

In C++ this is defined in the template 
\begin{lstlisting}
template <template<typename T1, typename... D> class F>
struct functor {

  //curried version
  template<typename A, typename B>
  static std::function < F<B> (F<A>)> fmap(std::function <B (A)> f);

  // uncurried, for functions..
  template<typename A, typename B>
  static F<B> fmap(std::function <B (A)> f, F<A> L) {
    return fmap(f)(L);
  }
};
\end{lstlisting}
The class F can have more than one template parameter, as indicated by the variadic template.
This allows specialization for containers since they have more than one template parameter.

Useful functors satisfy the following laws
\begin{eqnarray*}
fmap \; id = id  \\
fmap (g \; . \; f) = (fmap f) . (fmap f) 
\end{eqnarray*}

$.$ is the function composition operattor, read as $after$. It applies the function g after the fucntion f, viz.
\begin{eqnarray*}
(g \; . \; f)(x) = g(f(x)) 
\end{eqnarray*}


\subsection{Lists}
For lists like $std::list$ and $std::foward\_list$ fmap corresponds to map.
